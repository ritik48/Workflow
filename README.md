# 🔄 Workflow

Workflow is a simple web application built with React Flow that allows users to create and manage multiple workflows. Each workflow consists of interconnected nodes/cards that represent different tasks or stages in the workflow. Users can edit the details of each node and their positions are persisted using local storage.

## 🚀 Features

- Create multiple workflows with interconnected nodes.
- Edit the title and description of each node.
- Drag and drop nodes to rearrange them within the workflow.
- Connections between nodes are automatically saved.
- Node positions are persisted using local storage, ensuring that the layout is maintained even after page refresh.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Flow: A React component for building interactive node-based graphs.
- Local Storage: HTML5 feature used to store data locally within the user's browser.
